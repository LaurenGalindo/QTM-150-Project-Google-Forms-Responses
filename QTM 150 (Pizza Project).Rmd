# Who doesn't like free pizza?

##The Story

  I live in Longstreet Means Hall. On most days, I find clubs hosting meetings in our main lobby. Due to the clubs' efforts to attract members and satisfy hungry students, these clubs order multiple boxes of pizza. I smell cheese and pepperoni as I walk up to my room almost daily. There are also rumors that people go to club meetings just for the free pizza. In fact, I found myself and friends eating pizza at the DUC dining hall constantly. I can serve myself a slice at the dining halls, walk to Romeo's Pizza, or even order delivery! Pizza has become more accessible to me than ever before.
    
   One day, Longstreet Means was having an event in the main lobby, and as an incentive for people to participate, they advertised free pizza. I went up to my room and told my roommate to go downstairs because there was food--an offer that no sane person could turn down. However, she declined because she claims she does not eat pizza. I began to realize that since moving to Emory, I've had more pizza than I would have eaten if I had stayed at home. In fact, I hardly ate pizza at all when I was at home. 
    
  I assumed that others hardly ate pizza before coming to Emory as well and due to its increased availaility, it would have become a frequent part of everyone's diet. My hypothesis is that of all the first-years at Emory, there will be at least 70% who have increased their pizza intake since arriving to Emory. My roommate, however disagreed when I told her my hypothesis. She thinks that the percentage of people that have been eating more pizza is lower than 70%. 

## Data Collection

To find out whether or not students were consuming more pizza, I chose to conduct a poll via google sheets. I asked Emory freshmen to choose the number of pizza slices that they eat per week, the number of slices that they used to eat prior to attendind Emory, and whether or not they thought pizza was more accessible to them. 

I knew that the entire Emory student body would not answer so I used the respondents as a small sample of the entire population.

##Steps
First, I loaded the package ggplot2 by using the library function. The reason for doing this was so that I am able to manipulate and graph my google sheets data.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


Next, I imported my data and created the variable "Responses" so that I can easily refer to the dataframe.
```{r}
#assigning data to Responses variable
Responses <- read.csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSQuWMTYs4UA05hRVHwQSkRk3OCyy4a5gUJlcYPCVjaxOV_zcoB_jk7Jy4D-WE9--G6lv7dCEX5ennk/pub?output=csv")
```

I renamed the headers because the original headers were the questions that I asked in the google sheets poll, and its easier to refer to shorter variable names than to keep using the long variable name.

* **Timestamp** is the time that people responded to my poll.

* **Current** is the number of pizza slices that people say they currently eat per week.

* **Previous** is the number of pizza slices that people say they used to eat before arriving at Emory per week.

* **Reflection** is whether or not the respondants believe that they eat more or less pizza now than they used to before coming to Emory.

* **Reason** is the option that people believed they related to the most.

```{r}
#Renaming columns in Responses 
names(Responses) <- c("Timestamp", "Current", "Previous", "Reflection", "Reason")
```

I decided to plot the counted data in the form of a scatterplot. I used the ggplot package to graph my data. 

The x axis shows the number of pizza slices that people claim they used to eat before coming to Emory. The y axis shows the number of pizza slices that people claim they currently eat per week since being at Emory.

I initially chose geom_point to create a regular scatterplot. When I did this, however, I noticed that there were only 14 points on my graph. I knew that since there were 15 responses to my survey, someone must have chosen the same numbers as another person. 

```{r}
ggplot(Responses, aes(x= Previous, y=Current))+
  geom_point()
```

I then selected "geom_count" because this is a scatterplot as well, but it also counts the number of points that are the same and draws larger dots to reflect this. The point at (2,1) means that there are two people who claimed that they used to eat 2 slices of pizza, but now they only eat 1 per week. 

All responses were acounted for.

```{r}
ggplot(Responses, aes(x= Previous, y=Current))+
  geom_count()+
  labs(x="Previous number of slices eaten", y="Current number of slices eaten", title = "Previous vs Current number of slices eaten weekly")
```

I then needed to find a way to visually show if each respondant had increased or decreased their pizza intake. I did this by adding "geom_abline" to my graph. I made it have a slope of 1 because if a person's pizza intake did not change, then the point that represents them would lay directly on the line. The line also visually divides the respondants into two groups: those who currently eat more pizza lay above the line and those who currently eat less than they used to lay below.

```{r}
ggplot(Responses, aes(x= Previous, y=Current))+
  geom_count()+
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0)+
  labs(x="Previous number of slices eaten", y="Current number of slices eaten")
```

##Results
There were 10 people above the line and 5 people below the line. 
```{r}
10/length(Responses$Current)*100 #The percentage of people who ate more pizza
5/length(Responses$Current)*100 #The percentage of people who ate less pizza
```
66.67% of respondants eat more pizza than they used to.
33.33% of respondants eat more pizza than they used to.

##Possible errors
Since my sample size is so small, I believe that the final percentage of people who eat more pizza now should have been larger. Another source of error is the fact that people could have lied when answering the google form. 

#Conclusion
After calculating the percentage of people who ate more pizza since arriving at Emory, it is evident that my hypothesis was incorrect. Only 66.67% of respondants eat more pizza now that they are in college. I originally thought that it would have been 70% of respondants, however, that was not the case. My roommate won this argument, since she guessed that less than 70% of students have increased their pizza intake.
